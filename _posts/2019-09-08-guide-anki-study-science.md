I copy the relevant sentences in the textbook and put them in the Extra field. Then, when I'm reviewing cards, I don't make an effort to memorize those portions in the Extra fields. I just read them passively. On an exam, if something with similar words pop up, they will serve as a trigger for your mind to kind of remember back to that card.
