_Writing this in an effort to combat the insane jet lag that I've been suffering ever since returning from Europe (it's the wee hours of morning there), so sorry in advance for any errors!_

You know what, Southern Europeans have NO IDEA how good they have it because trying to compare the yogurt in North America to what's available over there is like... well, there's no real way to compare them since they're not even remotely similar, but even so, it's common sense to say the latter is far superior.

### De Nuestra Tierra (5/5 ★)

  I had to google what "oveja" means, and apparently it's Spanish for "sheep." When was the last time you had _sheep milk yogurt_? It tasted great. I can't describe _how_ it's different from normal yogurt, exactly, but that you can definitely tell it's something else. Perfect amount of sugar added. Creamy beyond belief.

  To top it off, the ceramic yogurt cup is adorable, and after a rinse it's now performing wonderfully as my toothbrush holder.

### Danone (1/5 ★)

  Madrid. Reviewed on 01/22.

  The facts that, 1) I've had bad experiences with Danone and 2) there were _minions_ decorating the label of this cup, should've sent me screaming down the aisle in the opposite direction, but unfortunately I was tricked by the labelling which claimed it was "Macedonia" flavour. My curiosity was piqued instantly. What did "Macedonia" flavour even mean? How could yogurt taste like an entire region in Southeastern Europe? Certainly we did not have this flavour back home, so I bought it and gave it a try.

  I regretted my decision as soon as the first spoonful hit my tongue. It tasted exactly like the artificial, pudding-like, vaguely-fruity-but-ultimately-ambiguous sugary stuff that proliferates on American store shelves. Turns out that _macedonia_ in Spanish is short for _macedonia de frutas_, aka fruit salad. Aka huge disappointment. As a non-Macedonian, I find this offensive.

### Yosoi (3.5/5 ★)

  Soygurt with real blackberries! How much better can you get? It was on the sweet side, and there were lots of blackberry seeds—like a massage for my tongue. Pretty runny compared to the North American varieties of soygurt I've encountered, but that's a characteristic I've noticed in most of the yogurt here, soy or not.

### Giglio (3/5 ★)

  Giglio didn't make much of an impression on me. It tasted fine, yeah, but nothing stood out. As you can see by my crappy unwrapping job, the tinfoil lid is a pain to yank off. I'd still eat it over most brands available here at the Canadian grocery stores any day.

### Soia (4/5 ★)

  I prefer this soygurt over the Yosoi. The taste is similar, but it's a bit smoother and thicker. It made for a satisfying start to a busy day. I wonder what happened to American soygurt? It seems to have vanished off the store shelves recently.

### AgriLanga (4.5/5 ★)

  One of those fruit-at-the-bottom varieties... although in Italy, the fruit/jam is usually found at the top of the cup lol. This particular brand had a perfect ratio of jam to yogurt; it's not as sweet as most of the other yogurts I had on this trip, but makes up for it in creaminess factor. It's thick and sticky and you can absolutely taste the shit-ton of milk that doubtless went into making this. Comes in a cute little glass container reminiscent of the De Nuestra Tierra cup.

  I know, I know... it looks disgusting... but _SO GOOD_...

  I bought these for the novel flavours (kiwi and pomegranate). They didn't look very appealing what with the watery juice and glowing fruit bits swilling around at the top, but the taste is great. I can't say it's a natural flavour, but it's delicious all the same. The only reason I wouldn't buy again is for fear of whatever neon chemicals I'm putting into my body.

  This brand was the closest I got to "North American-style" yogurt. Sweeter than the other varieties I tried, with less of the creamy taste. The consistency was overall more even than other brands as well, probably speaking to a higher gelatin content (I regret not noting the ingredients lists for these things). I liked the flavour of the strawberry one.

### Yomo & Melinda (3.5/5 ★)

  I bought this for the cheap price (most yogurts in Italy are around €1–€2 for two cups, and this one was €0.69) and the nostalgia. Do you remember when Activia carried the "apples & dates" flavour that mysteriously disappeared a few years ago? It was always my favourite... fuck you, Activia... Anyways, this Yomo thing had apples on it so I decided to try it out. It's not bad, especially at 35¢ a cup. And it did taste like the "apple & dates" Activia yogurt despite having no dates.

### Mukki (2.5/5 ★)

  ![mukki drinkable italian yogurt](/blog/images/mukki01.jpg){: width="30%"}{: .image-left}

  Pisa. Reviewed on 01/30.

  This was the last yogurt I bought on the trip, and the only drinkable one. I was not a fan; I thought it tasted weird and not really like blueberries as advertised, but my parents loved it. That's quite odd because neither of them are huge on yogurt. You do you Mom and Dad.

This is only a suspicion, but I think the EU has stricter food laws than Canada and America do. Or Europeans and North Americans have very different tastes when it comes to yogurt. Here at home, most grocery store yogurts don't taste creamy in the slightest and feel sort of gelatinized, probably because so many are low-fat. By contrast, I could _very_ clearly taste the dairy in all the yogurt I tried in Spain and Italy (except the discouraging Danone). The yogurt there was also a lot thinner and runnier than most in America.

I guess that concludes this special edition of _Yogurt in Review._ Thank you, thank you!
