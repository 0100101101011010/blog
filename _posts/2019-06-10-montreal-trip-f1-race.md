We just got back from Montreal today, and woooww what a fun weekend.

This is Kevin's first time in Montreal, and my second time. The first time, I went with my parents, and we mostly did sightseeing in the order of the [top ten attractions on TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attractions-g155032-Activities-Montreal_Quebec.html). I spent half a day in the Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal (Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) alone. We visited Saint Joseph's Oratory, walked around McGill University, checked out the buildings around Old Montreal... but this post is not about that trip!

For this trip, we pretty much went exclusively to watch the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix. My boyfriend has been an F1 fan for a long time, and while I'm not, I still wanted to watch a race in person at least once, just to see what it's like. Now that it's over, I can definitely say: it was worth it! Sure, it was tiring, hot, we both got sunburned, and at times I wanted to fall asleep... but I am still so glad to have had the experience.

Canada's one and only Formula One Grand Prix is held at Circuit Gilles Villenueve, on the island of Montreal. The entrance to the circuit is easily accessible, being right next to a subway station, but getting from the entrance to our seats is where the real journey begins. It took us almost an hour to walk to our grandstand

## Friday: Free Practice
