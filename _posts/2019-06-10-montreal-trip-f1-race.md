We just got back from Montreal today, and woooww what a fun weekend.

This is Kevin's first time in Montreal, and my second time. The first time, I went with my parents, and we mostly did sightseeing in the order of the [top ten attractions on TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attractions-g155032-Activities-Montreal_Quebec.html). I spent half a day in the Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal (Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) alone. We visited Saint Joseph's Oratory, walked around McGill University, checked out Vieux Port (the Old Port)... but today's post is not about that trip!

This weekend, we traveled to Montreal pretty much exclusively to watch the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix. My boyfriend is a long time F1 fan, and while I am not, I still wanted to watch a race in person at least once, just to see what it was like. And looking back, I can definitely say: it was worth it! Sure, the days were tiring and hot, we both got sunburned, and at times I wanted to fall asleep... but I am so glad I went. I know I just gave four reasons right there why it shouldn't have been enjoyable at all, but it was still a worthwhile experience. We've also learned a lot from this trip, so hopefully the next time we do something similar, we'll be more prepared.

Now that we're back in Waterloo where the thermometer is struggling to climb past 20 °C, I'm missing the hot, sunny ice cream weather days in Montreal.

## Thursday: Traveling to Montreal and Settling into our Airbnb

We traveled by train to Montreal. If you're starting from K–W, like us, you'll first have to catch a GO train from Kitchener Station to Union Station in Toronto. From there, you can ride the VIA Rail from Toronto straight to Montreal.

Because of all these transfers, scheduling options can be limited. We had to wake up at 5 am to catch a 5:40 train departing from Kitchener, then transferred to an 8:30 train from Toronto. Because it was so early, there weren't any buses running at the time, but luckily there were a couple of Ubers around.

The great thing about GO is that they are *always* on time. The only time I've heard of them being behind schedule was when a full-on blizzard was tearing through Toronto back in February, and a couple of my coworkers showed up late. It was a clear day when we set out at 5:40, and we showed up to Union Station perfectly on time.

The line up for Montreal was already long when we got to the gate, and it was reminiscent of the boarding area of an airport. Actually, most aspects of VIA Rail would come to remind me of air travel, but I'll get to that later. It looked like the train was near capacity, and we speculated on whether that was because of the upcoming Grand Prix. We saw a few people in the line wearing F1 attire so it's safe to say a good amount of the passengers were there for the race.

I was excited to use VIA, since I'd only ever taken the GO train from Toronto to Kitchener and had never been on a longer train ride in Canada. I had a romantic vision of sitting in plush seats, doing some homework or reading, and appreciating the rural scenery outside. Having tried it, I have to say I wouldn't do it again.

My one other long train ride experience took place on an overnight express from Shenzhen to Beijing, which definitely gave me that unrealistic idea of what train travel is like, and I'm sure anyone could tell you that Canada's train infrastructure lags way behind China's. The inside of a VIA coach is more like an airplane than anything else. The seats are a bit bigger than your average airplane seats, but there still isn't a lot of legroom. The tray tables are somehow *smaller* than the ones you can find on a plane, and my tiny Surface Pro barely even fit on the whole thing. The entire trip was as bumpy as a car ride, so we couldn't get any work done.

For most of the journey, I listened to music and drifted in and out of sleep. It's a five-hour ride, but it didn't seem that long because of how woozy I was. The whole time, I'd been feeling a little sick to my stomach because of the bumping and jostling, but not long after we arrived in Montreal in the late afternoon, we were both pretty hungry, since we hadn't eaten all day.

After dropping things off at our Airbnb, we hit up two popular local spots just a block away. You can read more about what we ate on my dedicated [Montreal food post](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-hello-montreal), since this post will be mainly about the logistics of getting around Montreal and the F1 Grand Prix.

Have I mentioned how amazing our Airbnb was, btw? It's an adorable studio apartment on Saint Laurent Blvd, which is known as the "Main Street" of Montreal, in the Mile End district. Every city has one of those artsy, historical neighbourhoods that's full of culture and good food, and Mile End is Montreal's. The weekend we were there, the annual [Mural Festival](https://muralfestival.com) was taking place a few blocks away.

We walked through this festival a couple of times throughout the weekend, but never really at "peak times" so I didn't take any photos. [This blog](https://the514lifeblog.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/mural-fest-2019-update-1/) has uploaded pics of many of the artworks on display and also captures the vibe of the festival in general.

## Friday: Free Practice Day

![f1 track](/blog/images/f1-1.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-right}

Canada's one and only Formula One Grand Prix is held at Circuit Gilles Villenueve, on the two little islands to the east of downtown Montreal. The entrance to the circuit is conveniently located next to a subway station, Jean-Drapeau, but getting from the entrance to our seats is where the real journey begins. It took us less than 30 minutes to walk from our Airbnb to Station Jean-Drapeau. It took us *almost an hour* just to walk to our grandstand, all the while breathing in cigarette smoke and dust kicked up from all the people milling around. The entire area surrounding the track looks like a fairground, with tents set up all around selling food, guidebooks, and F1 merchandise.

According to everyone in Montreal, the Thursday we arrived was the first day all year that felt like summer, so maybe some of the attendees were just citizens itching to get outdoors for the first time. I'm not sure if every race is this crowded, but all I know is that from Friday to Sunday, the entire area surrounding the circuit was consistently jammed with people.

In each Grand Prix, there are three Free Practice events prior to the big day, with the first and second FPs taking place on Friday and the third one on Saturday. A Free Practice, as explained by my boyfriend for uneducated bandwagoners like me, is an opportunity for drivers to get a feel for the track, for teams to run simulations, and for making adjustments to the car. Teams are no longer allowed to make adjustments to the cars post-FP, so they need to take advantage of what they learn during practice to optimize the vehicles for racing conditions.

Since we were both pretty tired last night, we got up close to noon on Friday and only made it in time for FP2. That was enough for me, tbh. From a fan's perspective, Free Practice is nothing special, although it is one of the first opportunities for us to actually watch the drivers on track. But after an hour and a half of watching drivers lap around, I felt like I'd seen enough.

The only one of two exciting moments of the day was the commentators announcing that Lewis Hamilton had some kind of hydraulic issue with his car, and he retired from the session early. The second one happened when a groundhog made its way onto the track!!

It's a running joke in F1 that Canada is the one race with high risk of wildlife interfering on the track, especially after Romain Grosjean turned on into puree during last year's race in Montreal. ([Warning: blurry but graphic](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/8pnh66/grosjean_onboard_hitting_the_animal_plus_team/?st=JI6H0KOG&sh=ea67d0c6))

We left soon after practice ended, and met up with my cousin for an early dinner at a hot pot restaurant. We were hoping to make it back to the track at 7 pm to take part in the "Grand Walk," where you can walk around on the track itself.

Unfortunately, it turns out this event wasn't included in the basic admission, and you had to have bought an additional ticket for that. I do wish F1 had made this clearer, because neither the schedule nor the tickets we'd bought had mentioned this being an exclusive event. Anyway, although we were kind of frustrated at being turned away at the entrance, we ended up being allowed onto the track after the race on Sunday, so we were able to take part in that experience anyway.
