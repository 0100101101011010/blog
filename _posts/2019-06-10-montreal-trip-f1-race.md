We just got back from Montreal today, and woooww what a fun weekend.

This is Kevin's first time in Montreal, and my second time. The first time, I went with my parents, and we mostly did sightseeing in the order of the [top ten attractions on TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attractions-g155032-Activities-Montreal_Quebec.html). I spent half a day in the Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal (Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) alone. We visited Saint Joseph's Oratory, walked around McGill University, checked out Vieux Port (the Old Port)... but today's post is not about that trip!

This weekend, we traveled to Montreal pretty much exclusively to watch the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix. My boyfriend is a long time F1 fan, and while I am not, I still wanted to watch a race in person at least once, just to see what it was like. And looking back, I can definitely say: it was worth it! Sure, the days were tiring and hot, we both got sunburned, and at times I wanted to fall asleep... but I am so glad I went. I know I just gave four reasons right there why it shouldn't have been enjoyable at all, but it was still a worthwhile experience. We've also learned a lot from this trip, so hopefully the next time we do something similar, we'll be more prepared.

Now that we're back in Waterloo where the thermometer is struggling to climb past 20 °C, I'm missing the hot, sunny ice cream weather days in Montreal.

## Thursday: Traveling to Montreal and Settling into our Airbnb

We traveled by train to Montreal. If you're starting from K–W, like us, you'll first have to catch a GO train from Kitchener Station to Union Station in Toronto. From there, you can ride the VIA Rail from Toronto straight to Montreal.

Because of all these transfers, scheduling options can be limited. We had to wake up at 5 am to catch a 5:40 train departing from Kitchener, then transferred to an 8:30 train from Toronto. Because it was so early, there weren't any buses running at the time, but luckily there were a couple of Ubers around.

The great thing about GO is that they are *always* on time. The only time I've heard of them being behind schedule was when a full-on blizzard was tearing through Toronto back in February, and a couple of my coworkers showed up late. It was a clear day when we set out at 5:40, and we showed up to Union Station perfectly on time.

The line up for Montreal was already long when we got to the gate, and it was reminiscent of the boarding area of an airport. Actually, most aspects of VIA Rail would come to remind me of air travel, but I'll get to that later. It looked like the train was near capacity, and we speculated on whether that was because of the upcoming Grand Prix. We saw a few people in the line wearing F1 attire so it's safe to say a good amount of the passengers were there for the race.

I was excited to use VIA, since I'd only ever taken the GO train from Toronto to Kitchener and had never been on a longer train ride in Canada. I had a romantic vision of sitting in plush seats, doing some homework or reading, and appreciating the rural scenery outside. Having tried it, I have to say I wouldn't do it again.

My one other long train ride experience took place on an overnight express from Shenzhen to Beijing, which definitely gave me that unrealistic idea of what train travel is like, and I'm sure anyone could tell you that Canada's train infrastructure lags way behind China's. The inside of a VIA coach is more like an airplane than anything else. The seats are a bit bigger than your average airplane seats, but there still isn't a lot of legroom. The tray tables are somehow *smaller* than the ones you can find on a plane, and my tiny Surface Pro barely even fit on the whole thing. The entire trip was as bumpy as a car ride, so we couldn't get any work done.

For most of the journey, I listened to music and drifted in and out of sleep. It's a five-hour ride, but it didn't seem that long because of how woozy I was. The whole time, I'd been feeling a little sick to my stomach because of the bumping and jostling, but not long after we arrived in Montreal in the late afternoon, we were both pretty hungry, since we hadn't eaten all day.

After dropping things off at our Airbnb, we hit up two popular local spots just a block away.

Have I mentioned how amazing our Airbnb was? It's an adorable studio apartment on Saint Laurent Blvd, which is known as the "Main Street" of Montreal, in the Mile End district. Every city has one of those artsy, historical neighbourhoods that's full of culture and good food, and Mile End is Montreal's. The weekend we were there, the annual [Mural Festival](https://muralfestival.com) was taking place a few blocks away.

## Friday: Free Practice


![f1 track](/blog/images/f1-1.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-right}

Canada's one and only Formula One Grand Prix is held at Circuit Gilles Villenueve, on the island of Montreal. The entrance to the circuit is easily accessible, being right next to a subway station, but getting from the entrance to our seats is where the real journey begins. It took us almost an hour to walk to our grandstand, all the while breathing in cigarette smoke and dust kicked up from all the people walking around. The entire area surrounding the track looks like a fairground, with tents set up all around selling F1 merchandise, food
