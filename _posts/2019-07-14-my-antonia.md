This post isn't so much a review as just a reflection.

I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Did *My Ántonia* explore worldview-changing themes or put forth worldview-changing ideas? Did it leave me pondering grand, abstract questions regarding the human condition? No.

It is a book that is just as humble as its protagonists, Jim and Ántonia.

What I loved about this book is how accessible it still is, how readable and engaging, 101 years to the date it was first published. Doesn't that say something about how masterfully Cather captures the childhood experience?

The immigrant part of me can relate to Ántonia and her family, the way the other settlers look mockingly on their foreign foods
