I switched over from Anki to RemNote because the latter combines two essential features of classroom learning (in my opinion): note-taking and flashcards. I find it very helpful to be able to see the context of a flashcard (ie. where it fits in within the overall course), which is difficult to achieve with Anki. I'm planning to write a mini-series on adopting RemNote and how to get the most out of the program. For the first part, I've compiled some screenshots that I think are representative of how I use Remnote for study. There are definitely other use cases for this website, like a daily journal or a to-do list, but I think note-taking is where it offers something really unique.

## Use Cases for Vocabulary and Memorization Heavy Courses

Below, screenshot for a business ethics course I took which basically involved memorization of terms. Pretty straightforward, similar to how I used to use Anki. You can see that I utilize both front-and-back type rems as well as cloze-deletion rems.

## Use Cases for Conceptual Courses

Here's my tax course:

These are notes for two of my accounting courses. I would say that these are the courses that benefit most from being able to view the context of each flashcard. See the [flashcard topic](#reviewing-flashcards-in-remnote) below to see why.

## LaTeX Formulas in RemNote

Now to be honest, I know next to nothing about LaTeX except that it can make equations look pretty. RemNote has pretty elegant functionality for it. You either type `$$` and start using LaTeX syntax directly, or write out your equation first, then highlight the entire thing, and type `$$`. Here's an example, starring the CAPM equation, within my corporate finance class notes:

## Reviewing Flashcards in RemNote

When you actually start reviewing flashcards, you'll notice the cards are a little different from Anki. The names of parent rems are shown to provide some context clues to the current card. For example, if I'm randomly asked this question about a `range of activity levels`, it might take me a while to figure out what concept this is even related to. But because the card provides a clue that it is part of `Cost Behaviour`, I remember fairly quickly that the answer is the `Relevant Range` within which cost behaviour is consistent and predictable.

Also, notice that you have an option for resizing the card-viewing window.

And you can type what you think is the answer and see how close you are to the correct one:

Here's what it looks like when you're wrong or don't type out a response:

Also, if there is another concept referenced within a flashcard, you can double-click on it to go to that rem's info page.

## References in RemNote

This is another one of my favourite features of RemNote: the ability to link to other pages. I think this is what many people like about the popular Roam Research tool as well. It prevents redundancy across all my notes. For example, a concept like `bonds` (the financial kind, not the BDSM type) shows up in both my finance and accounting courses. Instead of typing out a definition twice, I simply reference the same rem.

Within each page, you can also see all the rems that link to it to find out where else this topic has been mentioned. I don't use this feature particularly much, but it can be interesting sometimes to see the array of pages that a single concept is part of.

## Tags in RemNote

This screenshot below isn't from a course I'm taking; rather, it's an ongoing side project that I'm working on about the history of Spain. If you're taking a history course, literature course, or some other subject that requires citations, the "tags" feature could be really useful to help keep track of your sources.

## Portals in RemNote

While doing assignments, I find it helpful to have all the equations we learned in our statistics course consolidated in one area instead of scattered throughout the document. Something like that is where RemNote's portals come in handy. I use the same convention for all my equations, which is to include the word `formula` somewhere within the name of the rem. I then set a portal to search for all instances of `formula` within my ECON 221 notes page. Voila. It works like an Excel filter that extracts only the rows (in this case, rems) that you need.

## Images in RemNote

Images are also supported in RemNote! My preferred method of adding them is to simply take a screenshot (snipping tool or `shift`+`cmd`+`S`), paste (`ctrl`+`v`) where I want it to go, and drag the bottom-right corner to resize.
